# PPAT prototype
Multi-Party Function Evaluation with Perfectly Private Audit Trail
############################################################

The modules presented here contain 
- the core arithmetic needed to perform natural operations and pairings on BN- elliptic curves, extension fields, etc.
- instanciations of the CCE primitive
- the NIZKPoK needed to compute the PPAT for the test applications
- the test applications presented in the paper

the file script.py instantiate the CCE primitive
